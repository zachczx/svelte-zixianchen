I've recently been learning Go and using it for a [webapp that searches Government abbreviations and acronyms](https://abbreviation.zixian.dev). It's been a great journey so far, notwithstanding the subpar dev experience and the Svelte/Vite withdrawals that pop up from time to time. The way that Go encourages me to think about code has been really helpful. Not least the emphasis on writing left-aligned happy path code and constantly thinking about error handling. I also like HTMX, so it's all good using it with Chi and Templ.

Specific to UX, it's a UX best practice to show a loading animation if something takes 1s or more. (It's [not always necessary](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/), but I also find it more intuitive as a user myself.) So I usually add an animated loader.

## Problem: User Navigation Causes Flickering and White Flashes

Using HTMX's hx-indicator for a loading animation, however, annoyed me. I kept seeing flickering whenever I clicked something that did a hx-swap.

Hx-swap caused white flashes from very fast transitions. The hx-target element changed too quickly from Original Page > Loader > New Page, and this made it look like errors instead.

The obvious solution would be to set a delay, but unfortunately hx-indicator does not come in-built with a delay option.

## Solution 1: DIY Adding Delay (htmx:beforeRequest and htmx:afterRequest)

After some digging, the [HTMX creator gave some tips to DIY a delay](https://www.reddit.com/r/htmx/comments/10qxzji/set_a_minimum_time_for_an_hxindicator_animation/):

- Catch the htmx:beforeRequest event and set a variable or attribute on the DOM element, and start a timer (setTimeout())
- When the timeout occurs, check if the variable is still set and, if so, show an indicator
- Catch the htmx:afterRequest event and unset the variable, and clear any indicator

With these tips, I wrote something simple (with Tailwind in mind, but equally applies to plain CSS). It's probably something anyone can too, though this might help someone new to HTMX.

```js
// Added Javascript

let timer = false;
const cssClassesFadeOut = ['opacity-25', 'transition', 'ease-out', 'duration-200'];
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:beforeRequest', () => {
	let loaderBefore = document.getElementById('loading-spinner');
	let contentOut = document.getElementsByClassName('loaded-content');
	for (let i = 0; i < contentOut.length; i++) {
		contentOut[i].classList.add('opacity-25');
	}
	timer = true;
	setTimeout(() => {
		if (timer) {
			loaderBefore.classList.remove('hidden');
			loaderBefore.classList.add('grid');
			for (let i = 0; i < contentOut.length; i++) {
				contentOut[i].classList.add(...cssClassesFadeOut);
			}
		}
	}, 1000); // Delay of 1s as recommended by Nielsen Norman Group
});

document.body.addEventListener('htmx:afterRequest', () => {
	let loaderAfter = document.getElementById('loading-spinner');
	timer = false;
	loaderAfter.classList.add('hidden');
	loaderAfter.classList.remove('grid');
});
```

```html
<!-- Content and Loader -->

<div class="relative">
	<div id="loading-spinner" class="absolute inset-x-1/2 inset-y-1/2 hidden">...</div>
	<ul id="list">
		<li class="loaded-content grid grid-cols-3">...</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```

```html
<!-- Triggering Element -->

<button hx-get="/" hx-trigger="click" hx-push-url="true" hx-target="#list" hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true">
	...
</button>
```

I ended up not using hx-indicator, though I'm sure I'll eventually find out if that's a good choice.

## Solution 2: Do Transition Delay on hx-indicator Element

Add a CSS transition delay of 1000ms, so the CSS loader appears after 1000ms and we're still in between a htmx:beforeRequest and htmx:afterRequest.

There're 2 ways to go.

- If you're just doing opacity transitions, this should work perfectly, e.g. animating opacity 100% when loader shows and back to 0% thereafter.
- It's more complicated with _display: none_ transiting to _display: inline_ or _display: block_. Display none doesn't transit well. There're a couple of newish CSS properties that help with that - _transition-behavior: allow-discrete_ and _@starting-style_. Syntax Podcast had a great episode on this. Browser support is not fantastic, at ~71% support, so I won't be scrambling to use this at the moment.

## Solution 3: Use HTMX Loading States Extension

HTMX has an extension called [loading-states](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx-extensions/blob/main/src/loading-states/README.md). It offers an attribute _data-loading-delay_, which is really a setTimeout under the hood.

```html
<span class="loader" data-loading-delay="1000"></span>
```

I'd have opted for this if I found this first, instead of writing a couple of simple eventListeners. A very good option if you're not keen on tinkering with much under the hood. Set and forget it.
