# Working Around Google Photos' 20,000 Photo Album Limit

Google Photos caps albums at 20,000 photos. For someone with a large photo library who shares albums with family, this is a problem.

Once you hit the limit, new photos stop being added automatically. I don't usually keep track, so it can be a month or so till I realize the album wasn't adding new photos.

Creating a new album only captures photos from that point forwardâ€”missing everything between the old album's cutoff and the new one's start.

## The Workaround

This workaround is useful if you want to create a new album and auto add photos that carry on from the previous album.

Using the Google Photos web app:

1. Create a new album
2. Click the 3 dots menu on the top right corner > Options > Automatically add photos (For some reason it doesnt work if you clicked "Select people & pets" from the main empty album screen)
3. Select people & pets > select the person > Toggle "Also add existing photos"
4. Refresh the album page a few times until the date range roughly matches where your previous album ended (e.g. previous album ends at 30 August, so the new one can start from mid August).
5. Don't leave it auto adding too long, the UI takes some time to update and on the backend it already added more photos. For me I just leave it running for 10-20s, but ymmv. Sometimes you can end up with 15K photos added and the UI updating the count 10 mins later, so it's best to stop way ahead of time.
6. Options > Click the person > Stop auto-adding photos of this face
7. Options > Re-add the face > Make sure "Also add existing photos" is unchecked

## Google please do better!

Writing this so I can remember every half a year when I need to create a new album.

But seriously, Google, Photos is an incredibly useful product, but please make it easier to manage these auto adding albums or adjust the 20K limit!
